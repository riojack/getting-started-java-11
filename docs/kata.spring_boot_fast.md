## Rapidly stand up a REST API using Spring Boot

This should be pretty simple.  Let's stand up a very simple Spring Boot application.

### Kata requirements

Using the project structure that you've built so far, stand up a Spring Boot application.  Follow this tutorial provided by Spring: [Start an Application with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot).

1. Complete the Spring Boot tutorial through the "Run the Application" step.
2. Now drive out a new endpoint, different from the one created in the tutorial, by using the testing methodology outlined in the "Add Unit Tests".
3. Delete the endpoint from the tutorial. (It has no test coverage.)
4. The application must be runnable from the command line.
